CSSR uses a modified version of the open-source
[RNAstructure](https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructure.html) library
(original version 6.2 PARTITION_CORE). The modified library used by CSSR
is under the src/, RNA_class/ and data_tables/ folders of this package.

CSSR also uses a modified version of the open-source
[LinearPartition](https://github.com/LinearFold/LinearPartition).
The modified code are at
